168: december 21 2019
	Added "Alert Whisper"
	If you ctrl+v ingame and it is a message to a player (first character is an @ symbol), the watcher will alert you if you've already sent that message.
	It stores the last 7 messages youve pasted to a player and shows them all.
	Helps you not spam people when trade sites duplicate data while you scroll.
	Can disable in settings. "Alert whisper" in the first column near the top.

	ctrl+v is created as a hotkey that only fires when PoE is active if the setting is enabled.
	If the setting is disabled, the hotkey will not be fired, nothing will run, no messages will be logged.
	If you would like to inspect the code, the relevant lines in heavy.ahk in this version are: 304, 1398, 1593
